---***Generate basic unit test scaffolding for your OpenAPI specification***---

Mocha testcases are generated for each endpoints present in the OpenAPI specification. 

Here we will see how to feed data to the test cases and run the test cases.

As part of test case generation following files will be available,

1. Mocha test cases - Prefilled Unique IDs for all the parameters present in the test cases. The Unique ID pattern is Endpoint_Operation_OpertationType_ResponseCode.
2. testcaseInput.csv file - to get the input from user for each parameter
3. runner.js - to run the generated Mocha test cases by with the value provided in the csv.

Following are the steps to run the test case:

1. Fill in the parameter value under ParamValue column in testcaseInput.csv
2. Execute following command: "node runner.js" - results will be available in the terminal.
